![top-10-vs-code-extensions-to-level-up-your-development-game](https://blog.sparshagarwal.xyz/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.hashnode.com%2Fres%2Fhashnode%2Fimage%2Fupload%2Fv1627103867388%2Ft-9hxpsTq.png%3Fw%3D1600%26h%3D840%26fit%3Dcrop%26crop%3Dentropy%26auto%3Dcompress%2Cformat%26format%3Dwebp&w=1920&q=75)

VS Code is probably the most used code editor in the world. One of the main reasons why it has become so popular is its ability to install additional features by using extensions. There are more than thousands of extensions available on VS Code. But it can be really hard to find the extensions you might be looking for.

## 1. Better Comments

```

This extension allows you to add semantics to your comments. You can categorize comments into:

- Any other comment styles you'd like can be specified in the settings
